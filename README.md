<h1> 👋👋👋 Hello world! 👋👋👋</h1>
<h3>My current professional work doesn't allow me contribute to collaboration as much as I'd like, but I'm a constant lurker 👀 around these parts and want to share more of my personal work! 🔄</h3>
<br>I am not always writing code. I'm frequently using SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Qualtrics, Airtable, advanced Excel, ArcGIS Pro, SPSS, and more. I honestly do like learning new stuff. I’m currently learning Python 🐍 I've written a few things here and there over the past few years, but I want to become a Python pro! 
<br><br>When I'm not behind a computer screen, I like to go hiking 🐾 with my wife 🙋‍♀️ and watch movies 📼
<br><h2>I'm a real person named Alex (he/him) if you want to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexvardell">find me on LinkedIn</a></h2>
